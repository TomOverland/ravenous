A client-side React application, utilizing the Yelp API to search for local businesses. I deployed this site to Github Pages. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description:

This full stack application allows a user to search for a restaurant using Yelp's API, and will display a list of restaurants based on food type on submit.  The user is able to filter their search by "best match", "highest rated", and "most reviewed". This project was based on a project prompt I received from Codecademy's "Create a Front End Application with React" lesson plan. I deployed this application to Github Pages with the gh-pages npm package.
